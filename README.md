# Temp_Humidity_Display
Displaying the temperature and humidity using a microcontroller

Everything besides the T_H_Display file was not created by me

Need to add the circuit diagram for wiring and parts

To run open the T_H_Display file in Arduino IDE and upload to microcontroller with other files in a folder
